# Lecture 09-3: OPERATORS AND DESTRUCTORS

This lecture folder contains the `Rational` and `Stck` classes
covered as examples in Lecture 09-3, as well as the slides that
describe them. 

You'll see that the `samples` folder has two versions of
`Rational`. There's a simple one that mimics the lecture. There's
a richer and more complex one that uses `const` and passing by
reference, things that will be covered at a later date.

Note also that the `Stck` client in the `samples` differs from
the one in the slides. It instead is a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
calculator, similar to the Unix utility `dc`. Check it out.

Each of the same folders has a `Makelfile`, so you can just type 
`make` when youi are working ion any of those folders.
